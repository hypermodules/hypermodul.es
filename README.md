## FAQ

What is this?
:   Hypermodules started as a github org to facilitate the development of hyperamp, a desktop music player built with web technologies.  Now it houses related libraries and tools that benefit from [collective open source ownership](https://twitter.com/zeke/status/826504522679791616).

What is hypermodular development?
:  Hypermodular development generally refers to a style of software development that emerged from early Node.js module authoring patterns.  There is no official definition but the they seem to follow a few general patterns:
    - [Unix-Like Philosophy](http://substack.net/many_things): Modules solve one problem well.  Default to existing Unix conventions where they exist.
    - [Written, Documented and Tested in isolation](https://gist.github.com/substack/68f8d502be42d5cd4942#gistcomment-1365106).
    - Principal of least action: Don't abstract or complicate things any more than they really need to be.
    - [Hide your implementation](https://opbeat.com/community/posts/hypermodular-development-by-mathias-buus/): Use `require` to hide implementation details.  [Find common ground](https://github.com/maxogden/abstract-blob-store) with [other](https://github.com/juliangruber/abstract-random-access) [modules](https://github.com/Level/abstract-leveldown) in the problem domain if you can.  Avoid plug-in ecosystems.
    - Don't shoot for the github stars: github stars are a bad quality metric.  [Use what others turn to](http://node-modules.com/?u=bcomnes).
    - [Keep it non-fancy](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/tiny-guide-to-non-fancy-node).
    - ["INSTALL WE TRUST"](http://module.party): things should work as expected.
    - Open source and permissively licensed on github.

Can I contribute?
:   Sure!  Hop on.

Can I join the org?
:   Probably, especially if you already have access to repos in the org.  Reach out to a publicly listed [org member](https://github.com/orgs/hypermodules/people).

Is there an IRC channel?
:   `#hypermodules` on freenode.
    <a href="https://www.irccloud.com/invite?channel=%23hypermodules&amp;hostname=irc.freenode.net&amp;port=6697&amp;ssl=1" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/IRC-%23hypermodules-1e72ff.svg?style=flat-square"  height="20"></a>

What's with the background?
:    Its a picture taken by [PSU](https://www.pdx.edu/cemn/)'s FEI Tecnai F-20 tunneling electron microscope of some kind of gold lattice structure.  Molecules and hypermodules share the same kind of vibe. ☯
